# Assignment README

This repository contains the code for the Week 3 Assignment. The assignment consists of three tasks, each organized in its respective folder.

## Task 1

### Files

- `task1.c`: Implementation file for Task 1.
- `task1.h`: Header file for Task 1 including required function defintions.

## Task 2

### Files

- `task2.h`: Header file for Task 2 including required function defintions.
- `task2_bfs.c`: Implementation file for Task 2, containing the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
- `task2_dfs.c`: Implementation file for Task 2, containing the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.
- `bfs.md`: Markdown file describing applications of the Breadth-First Search algorithm.
- `dfs.md`: Markdown file describing applications of the Depth-First Search algorithm.

## Task 3

### Files

- `task3.md`: Markdown file for Task 3. This file contains the response for the third task.

## Instructions for Compilation and Execution

### Task 1

- Open a terminal in the `task1` directory.
- Compile the code using a C compiler (e.g., gcc): `gcc task1.c -o task1.out`
- Run the executable: `./task1.out`

### Task 2

- Open a terminal in the task2 directory.
- Compile the BFS code: gcc task2_bfs.c -o task2_bfs.out
- Compile the DFS code: gcc task2_dfs.c -o task2_dfs.out
- Run the executables: ./task2_bfs.out and ./task2_dfs.out

### Task 3

- Open the task3.md file to access the documentation for Task 3.
