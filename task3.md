# Task 3

## 4 applications of the graph theory

**Network Analysis:**

- **Vertices:** Represent individual entities, such as computers, cities, or people.
- **Edges:** Connect entities and represent relationships or interactions between them.
- **Application:** By studying how entities are connected (edges), we can optimize communication, transportation, or social interactions within a network.

**Chemical Structure:**

- **Vertices:** Represent atoms in a chemical compound.
- **Edges:** Represent chemical bonds connecting atoms.
- **Application:** Understanding the arrangement of atoms (vertices) and bonds (edges) helps analyze and predict the properties and behavior of chemical compounds.

**Game Theory:**

- **Vertices:** Represent possible states or configurations of a game.
- **Edges:** Represent legal moves or transitions between game states.
- **Application:** By modeling games as graphs, we can analyze strategies and decision-making, studying how different moves (edges) lead to various outcomes.

**Criminal Network Analysis:**

- **Vertices:** Represent individuals involved in criminal activities.
- **Edges:** Represent relationships or interactions between individuals.
- **Application:** Analyzing the connections (edges) between individuals (vertices) helps identify key players, understand the structure of criminal networks, and devise effective intervention strategies.
